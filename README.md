# Automobile-Dataset-Analysis

## Overview
The project provides a comprehensive introduction to data analysis concepts and demonstrates their application using an automobile dataset. The project covers data types, analysis methods, visualization techniques, and statistical tests. The analysis reveals relationships between various car features and price, such as the strong positive correlation between horsepower and price. It also investigates the difference in curbweight between sedan and wagon car bodies, concluding no statistically significant difference based on the presented analysis. The project effectively utilizes Python libraries and visualizations to explore and explain the data.

## Data Details
The dataset used is from a private source and contains information about 205 instances (cars) and 26 features. The goal of the analysis is to understand factors influencing car pricing. The features include:
- Car ID: Unique identifier for each car.
- Symboling: Insurance risk level (a value from -3 to +3, indicating riskier to safer cars).
- CarName: Name of the car.
- Fueltype: Type of fuel used.
- Aspiration: Aspiration type.
- Doornumber: Number of doors.
- Carbody: Type of car body.
- Drivewheel: Type of drive wheels.
- Enginelocation: Location of the engine.
- Wheelbase: Distance between front and rear wheels.
- Carlength: Length of the car.
- Carwidth: Width of the car.
- Carheight: Height of the car.
- Curbweight: Weight of the car.
- Enginetype: Type of engine.
- Cylindernumber: Number of cylinders.
- Enginesize: Size of the engine.
- Fuelsystem: Type of fuel system.
- Boreratio: Ratio between cylinder bore diameter and piston stroke length.
- Stroke: Distance the piston travels.
- Compressionratio: Ratio of cylinder volume and head space.
- Horsepower: Metric unit for engine power.
- Peakrpm: Revolutions per minute at peak RPM.
- Citympg: Fuel efficiency in the city.
- Highwaympg: Fuel efficiency on the highway.
- Price: Price of the car.
